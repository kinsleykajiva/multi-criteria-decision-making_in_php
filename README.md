+ This is really based on context !
- This  is really simple it attempts to  suggest a decision based on the data give <br> to the model it self .
-At the moment i haven't made serious documentation to the the application or the git project <br> but if one is to dive into the repository they will discover the simplecity of the application given that there is <br>
general appreciation of the model in theory first .
-<h4> Links to the theory : </h4>

 - So  as you go through some of these links you will find that you will need tyo work the math out to prove the model it self .
 <br> i would highly suggest that you use Ms Excel to prove the math just to make sure that you are doing the right thing .
 + i hav added an excel file (mcd.xlsx) that i used to test the math behind so the last set values in the Excel file <br> are the same as the 1 in the Code in this repository .

 <h2> Conclusion </h2>
 
 Feel free to use the code and customise it to your understanding and situation !
 + I do apologise if i dont document  properly in time of your need .
